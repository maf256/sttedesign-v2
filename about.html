                <h2>Recognized CMS</h2>
                <P>Wordpress accounts for 60% of the market. In second place we find other CMS.
                    Over the years, we have used the two most well-known platforms for website development - WordPress and Joomla. We have developed a number of different solutions, which cover very different needs. In recent years, we have focused on WordPress. WordPress is a solution that makes it quick to implement a new website. Opportunity for fantastic design and a number of plug-ins makes many customers prefer WordPress.</P>

                <h2>Responsive design</h2>
                <P>Did you know that 70% of users who visit your website use a smartphone?
                    "Mobile first" - by that we mean that your website design should be as good on mobile as on desktop. Your customers will find all available information, on all screen sizes. When using responsive design, navigation and readability will work the same on all devices such as mobile, iPad, laptop and desktop.</P>
